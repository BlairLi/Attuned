# Attuned Voice

The independent study project entails the creation and refinement of "Attuned," a cutting-edge, open-access VCMT (Voice and Communication Modification Therapy) app, with a primary focus on serving the needs of TGGD (Transgender, Genderqueer, Gender Diverse) individuals. The project is expected to follow evidence-based standard care practices in speech pathology, utilizing feedback directly from TGGD individuals to ensure the app is health-literate, inclusive, and easily accessible. The student, under the guidance of their independent study advisor, is tasked with contributing to the app's content development, evaluating its quality and functionality, and enhancing its user experience design.
